Read the first packet and found a instructions.txt file. Used https://www.cachesleuth.com/multidecoder/ and found decoded text in ROT13:
TFTPDOESNTENCRYPTOURTRAFFICSOWEMUSTDISGUISEOURFLAGTRANSFER.FIGUREOUTAWAYTOHIDETHEFLAGANDIWILLCHECKBACKFORTHEPLAN

So maybe there are more such files, but there are too many packets to manually inspect. Using this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/wireshark/comments/6ndvpq/extract_tftp_file_from_pcapng/ found and extracted the other files.

The plan file was similarly ROT-13 encoded.
Decoded to :
IUSEDTHEPROGRAMANDHIDITWITH-DUEDILIGENCE.CHECKOUTTHEPHOTOS

Next file was a program, so looked into the program.deb file and found **steghide**, which meant the flag must in one of the 3 photos, but steghide needs a password to extract the text.
Pass: DUEDILIGENCE

Used succesfully on picture2.bmp
