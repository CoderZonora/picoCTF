I first searched on how can two different files have the same md5 hash. This led me to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1756004/can-two-different-strings-generate-the-same-md5-hash-code
and further to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack.


Read about how it works and searched for a md5 collision pdf generator which led me to https://github.com/corkami/collisions.
Downloaded the two free samples and uploaded on the site to get the index.php file which had the flag in it.
