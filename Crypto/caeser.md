The given file had : picoCTF{dspttjohuifsvcjdpoabrkttds}
Caeser cipher of **dspttjohuifsvcjdpoabrkttds** directly did not work. 
Used https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher to get all combinations and the +1 combination gave **crossingtherubiconzaqjsscr** which was the only one withactual english words. 
Tried that and it worked.
