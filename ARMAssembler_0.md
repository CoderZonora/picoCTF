Used https://www.codeconvert.ai/assembly-to-c-converter to convert the assembly code into C code.
Read about the atoi() method and used

```
printf("%x\n",atoi("3854998744"));
printf("%x",atoi("915131509"));

```
to print the hex code of the arguments which gave **e5c69cd8** and **368bcc75** as output. Used ``e5c69cd8`` for the flag as the function func1 in the assembly returned the higher of the two arguments.

Flag: picoCTF{e5c69cd8}
