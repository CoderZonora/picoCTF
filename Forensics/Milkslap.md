Inspected the site to get http://mercury.picoctf.net:48380/concat_v.png and downloaded it. 
Tried normal methods like xxd,bitwalk, exif, XMP but that did not give the flag.

Then tried to use AperiSolve but it did not work for such a large file. The tried one by one and using zsteg but file was too large. So split it and the first part itself gave the flag.
